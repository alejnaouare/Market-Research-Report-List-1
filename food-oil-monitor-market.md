<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Oil Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immersion</li><li>Non-immersion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Food Oil Monitor market is divided into two primary types: immersion and non-immersion. Immersion monitors are designed to be submerged directly in cooking oil, providing real-time temperature and quality measurements. These monitors are ideal for deep-frying and other applications where oil is consistently used. Non-immersion monitors, on the other hand, measure oil parameters from outside the container, offering a safer and more convenient option for monitoring. Both types serve to enhance food quality and operational efficiency in culinary settings.</p></p>
